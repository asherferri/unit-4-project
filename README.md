# The switch

A home automation utility.

## The App

This App will allow the user to control electronic devices, from anywhere in the world, hopefully the universe.

### What is your project?

With the GPIO and proccesing power of a R31416, a solid backend and a dependable server i have built a home automation
system, at the moment it controls a funny projection lamp and a couple of light emiting diodes, but it can basically control,
anything that requires electricity, acting as a smart hub...or anything i can get asked to do.
