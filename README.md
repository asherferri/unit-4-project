# The switch

A home automation utility.

## The App

This App will allow the user to control electronic devices, from anywhere in the world, hopefully the universe.

### What is your project?

With the GPIO and proccesing power of a R31416, a solid backend and a dependable server i have built a home automation
system, at the moment it controls a funny projection lamp and a couple of light emiting diodes, but it can basically control,
anything that requires electricity, acting as a smart hub...or anything i can get asked to do.

### Wireframes!

### User Stories

- User access a website
- User sends ON request.
- Device turns on.
- User sends OFF request.
- Device shuts off.

### Circuit Diagram Evolution:

The first challenge was to find a way to use Javascript to control the GPIO pins on the R31416.

Second challenge was to be able to control it through another computer, at least inside the same network...a server maybe?? but HOWWWW???

When i was finally able to control the inputs not only from the local network, but had turned the r31416 on a server that hosted the site with all controls of the GPIO and the LED turned ON!!

Now it was time to make the little monster machine functional in a real home environment, added a relay some frankensteined electronics and IT WORKED!! at around 3:30 EST in the AM it worked.

### The Beginning...

The first time the LED turned on by a local input:
